sit.ps1 (ALL-PY-SRC-REPOS)
============================================================
Updated: 2026-08-15 (uses pyproject.toml [dependency-groups]; uv sync installs dev and docs groups by default)

Situate project dependencies, lint, test, and build docs.
For Python tooling repos only.

Run with:
.\sit.ps1

# ============================================================
# Precheck: pyproject.toml must use [dependency-groups], not the
# old [project.optional-dependencies]. With the old table, `uv sync`
# succeeds but does NOT install dev/docs, and later steps fail confusingly.
